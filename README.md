# Magnetic field evoltuion in isolated radio pulsars and magnetars

This code can be used to model magnetic field evolution of isolated radio pulsars.
All equations and parameters can be found in Igoshev & Popov (2018) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473.3204I/abstract

The dipolar, poloidal component of magnetic field evolves due to the Ohmic decay (phonon and impurity resistivity) and Hall evolution.

The code can calculate magnetic field, spin period and period derivative for any moment of evolution.
